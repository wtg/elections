			<p>As Grand Marshal, I want to create permanent improvements to the health and quality of student life in our community by increasing access to support resources, encouraging a stronger sense of communal advocacy, and continued student involvement into quality of life issues.</p>
			<p>I will develop a stronger academic support network:
				<ul>
					<li>Pursue an advanced mentoring program through collaboration with the Faculty Senate, providing students accessible support for high-level coursework.</li>
					<li>Promote research development by concluding our work for an easily accessible list of past and present research opportunities.</li>
					<li>Provide effective solutions to student issues including transparency in course selection, timing of the drop deadline, and effective allocation of class resources.</li>
					<li>Install clear channels of representation between governing bodies among the students, faculty, and staff to provide a pipeline for student projects to receive higher support.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>I will encourage a stronger sense of community involvement and cultural advocacy:
				<ul>
					<li>Revive the Community Relations Committee with a focus on Troy outreach and intercollegiate student interaction.</li>
					<li>Expand collaboration with neighboring student governments, increasing the ability of the Union governing bodies to represent student interests.</li>
					<li>Develop a thriving, diverse community by personally expanding events that facilitate cultural and social awareness.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>I will encourage continued and expanded student involvement into quality of life issues:
				<ul>
					<li>Focus on more effective solutions to campus safety and security concerns that minimize day-to-day interference with student life.</li>
					<li>Enhance the practice of student-led projects by increasing recognition of the RPI Petitions service and obtaining faculty support whenever possible.</li>
					<li>Develop stronger connections between individual Senators and student groups for direct representation of their concerns.</li>
				</ul>
